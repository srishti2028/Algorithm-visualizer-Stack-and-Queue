# Algorithm Visualizer: Stack & Queue

## Overview
This project is an **interactive Algorithm Visualizer** that demonstrates how **stack** and **queue** data structures work. It provides **visual animations** for operations such as **push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue**. The visualizer is designed to help students and beginners understand these data structures clearly.

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** C (handles stack and queue operations)

---

## Features
- Visual representation of **Stack (LIFO)** and **Queue (FIFO)**
- Supports **array-based** and **linked-list-based** implementations
- Step-by-step **animation** for each operation
- Interactive UI to perform operations in real-time
- Backend computation in **C** with output passed to frontend
